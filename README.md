<h3 align="left">Steps on how to make a GitHub page</h3>
<p align="left">
  <b>1.</b> Create a repository in GitHub that will contain the files for the website. <br>
  <b>2.</b> Create or place the files that will be used for the website, such as the index.html and the .css stylesheet file. <br>
  <b>3.</b> Go to the settings tab, and under code and automation, go to the pages tab. <br>
  <b>4.</b> Select the branch to choose which branch to get the source files from. <br>
</p>

<h3 align="left">Takeaway</h3>
<p align="left"> In this exercise I have realized that it is very time consuming to create simple layouts in HTML and CSS. It is because of how lengthy the tags are, such as needing to type the entire closing tag again, as opposed to other languages where elements are depicted as Element() instead of &lt;Element&gt;&lt;/Element&gt;. Having verbose code also makes it harder to read, so I had to rely on documentation and indentations to keep track of what each section of the code does.
